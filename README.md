This project is a simple showcase of the Game of Life by Conway created in the following typescript playground: https://ts-web-playground-server-bfdfbjcthubcardq.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/. It shows the current state of the Game of Life on the left and lets the user restart the simulation, additionally the user can change the speed of the simulation and the number of randomly generated cells when the simulation is started. Furthermore there is a simple fps counter in the console.
The code is structured into multiple classes one for simple ui elements, e.g.: Buttons a class for creating drag tools, then a class where the simulation grid is handeled, another one for simple data gathering.
Feel free to play around with the code and implement your one ideas. Maybe add the option for the user to paint their own cells.
